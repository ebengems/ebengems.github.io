Our project assists human resource administrators in producing an accurate and speedy payment and tax calculation for the workforce. Myself and Francis Nwuko make up our team. As an engineering challenge, we wanted to concentrate on two things: developing a web- and mobile-friendly experience and finding a trustworthy, unambiguous app. While I worked on the technical side, Francis audited the code.

It was simple for our team to agree on a project focus because everyone on it likes to dabble with numbers. Iâ€™ve never found a payment computation sheet to be so simple and straightforward, so Francis and I brainstormed methods to make this procedure simpler and came up with this app. There have been numerous meetings, discussions, and trials before we get it right. I found it to be a really difficult project, but my passion for numbers kept me going. I want to give as many businesses as I can access to a more open and transparent payroll system.
